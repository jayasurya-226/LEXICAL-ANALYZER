Project Description  : -

A Lexical Analyzer (also called a Lexer or Scanner) is the first phase of a compiler. The main purpose of this project is to read a source program as input and convert it into a sequence of meaningful tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, numbers, and special symbols.

This project is implemented on Ubuntu Linux using the gcc compiler. The lexical analyzer scans the input text character by character and groups them into valid tokens using pattern matching rules. Each token is classified based on predefined lexical rules.

The project demonstrates basic concepts of Compiler Design, such as:

Character stream reading

Token formation

Removing whitespace and comments

Categorizing tokens

Reporting lexical errors (invalid characters)

 Features of the Project

Detects and classifies:

Keywords (e.g., int, if, while)

Identifiers (e.g., count, total)

Operators (+ - * / = == < >)

Numbers (e.g., 345, 9.5)

Special Symbols ({ } ( ) ; ,)

Ignores comments and whitespace

Displays token type and lexeme clearly

Runs directly using gcc in Ubuntu Terminal

Easy to modify and extend

 Objectives

To understand the working of lexical analysis in compiler design

To design a program that converts input code into tokens

To learn Linux environment program compilation using gcc

To implement pattern-based token recognition in C
