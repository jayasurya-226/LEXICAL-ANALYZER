# LEXICAL-ANALYZER
Lexical Analyzer in C: This project implements a lexer that reads C source code and converts it into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, constants, and delimiters. It ignores comments/whitespace, detects invalid tokens, and outputs a list of tokens with type and value.
